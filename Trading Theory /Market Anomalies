Definition:
    Market anomalies are irregularities in financial markets where asset prices deviate from what is predicted
    by the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which states that all known information is already reflected in asset prices.
    These anomalies suggest that inefficiencies may exist, offering potential opportunities for excess returns.

1. Momentum Anomaly:
    Stocks that have performed well over the past 3 to 12 months tend to continue performing well in the short term, while poorly performing stocks tend to continue underperforming
    Strategy: Buy stocks that have exhibited strong upward momentum and short stocks with downward momentum

2. January Effect
    Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks in January, likely due to tax-loss selling at the end of the previous year
    Strategy: Buy small-cap stocks in December and hold through January to capitalize on this effect

3. Mean Reversion Anomaly:
    Stocks that deviate significantly from their historical average tend to revert to the mean over time
    Strategy: Buy stocks that have dropped sharply below their average and sell those that have surged above their historical average

4. Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD):
    Stocks tend to continue moving in the same direction after a significant earnings announcement. Positive earnings surprises tend to be followed by further upward price movement, and negative surprises by further downward movement
    Strategy: Buy stocks with positive earnings surprises and short those with negative earnings surprises

5. Weekend Effect:
    Stock returns tend to be lower on Mondays compared to other days of the week, often due to negative news that accumulates over the weekend.
    Strategy: Sell positions on Friday afternoon and buy on Monday after a potential dip in prices.
