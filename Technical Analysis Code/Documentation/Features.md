Standard Deviation: Measures how widely returns are dispersed from the average return. It’s the most common (and biased) estimator of volatility.

Parkinson's: Uses the stock’s high and low price of the day rather than just close to close prices. It’s useful to capture large price movements during the day.

Garman-Klass: Extends Parkinson's volatility by taking into account the opening and closing price. As markets are most active during the opening and closing of a trading session, it makes volatility estimation more accurate.

Hodges-Tompkins: Is a bias correction for estimation using an overlapping data sample that produces unbiased estimates and a substantial gain in efficiency.

Rogers-Satchell: Is an estimator for measuring the volatility of securities with an average return not equal to zero. Unlike Parkinson and Garman-Klass estimators, Rogers-Satchell incorporates a drift term (mean return not equal to zero).

Yang-Zhang: Is the combination of the overnight (close-to-open volatility), a weighted average of the Rogers-Satchell volatility and the day's open-to-close volatility.
