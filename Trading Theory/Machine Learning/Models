Definition:
A machine learning model is a system that uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.
It is trained on historical data to generalize insights for future predictions.

1. Linear Regression
    Use: Predicts future price or returns based on the linear relationship between input features (e.g., historical prices, volume) and the target variable (e.g., future price).

2. Logistic Regression
    Use: Predicts the probability of a binary outcome, such as whether a stock will go up or down, based on input features.

3. Decision Trees
    Use: Models decision-making by splitting data into branches based on feature values, useful for classifying market conditions or predicting price movement.

4. Random Forest
    Use: An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting and increases accuracy in predictions, often used for price forecasting and trading signals.

5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Use: Finds the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes (e.g., buy or sell signals), used in classification tasks for asset price direction.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Use: Predicts the price movement based on the "nearest" historical data points, useful for pattern recognition and price classification.

7. Neural Networks
    Use: Learns complex, non-linear relationships in data for predicting stock prices or generating trade signals. Common in high-frequency trading (HFT) and price prediction.

8. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    Use: A type of neural network designed for sequential data, ideal for analyzing time series data like stock prices or market trends over time.

9. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
    Use: An ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees sequentially, optimizing the model based on previous errors, often used in price prediction.

10. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
    Use: A more advanced and efficient version of gradient boosting, popular for both classification (e.g., trend direction) and regression tasks (e.g., price prediction).

11. Autoencoders
    Use: A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, often applied to reduce dimensionality or for anomaly detection in trading patterns.

12. K-Means Clustering
    Use: An unsupervised algorithm that groups assets based on similarities, useful for identifying market regimes or clustering similar stock behavior.

13. Bayesian Networks
    Use: Probabilistic models that predict future outcomes based on conditional dependencies between variables, used in risk management and asset price prediction.

14. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    Use: A learning approach where an agent makes trading decisions to maximize cumulative rewards (e.g., profit), commonly used in algorithmic trading and portfolio optimization.

15. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    Use: Traditionally used for image recognition, CNNs are applied to trading by treating price charts or technical indicators as images to identify patterns for trading signals.
