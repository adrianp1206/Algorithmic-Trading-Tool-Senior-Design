This project aims to create an advanced trading platform that simplifies the investment process by using machine learning to analyze market data and make informed trading decisions. The platform will predict stock price movements, generate actionable trading signals, and optimize portfolio management, all while offering a user-friendly interface. By integrating various data sources and real-time indicators, it will help users identify trends, determine the best times to buy or sell, and adjust their investments to maximize returns and minimize risks. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a fully automated system that empowers users to trade confidently and efficiently based on personalized insights and current market conditions.
