# Team Meeting Notes - February 20, 2025

**Date:** February 20, 2025  
**Time:** 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM  

## Meeting Agenda
1. **Prototype Testing**: Deciding what to present during the second prototype testing.  
2. **Lab Testing Plan**: Outlining what will be tested in the lab next week.  
3. **Project Updates**: Reviewing progress and resolving existing issues.  
4. **Next Steps**: Assigning tasks and responsibilities moving forward.  

## Attendees
- Yagiz  
- Adrian  
- Gabe  

## Key Topics Discussed

### Testing with NLP, LSTM, and XGBoost
- Plan to showcase **NLP testing** using **LSTM** and **XGBoost**, based on the work done last semester.
- **Challenges with NLP API:**  
  - Data availability starts from **2021**, which creates issues for training.  

### Notebook for Testing
- **Adrian** will create a **notebook** containing:  
  - NLP model testing  
  - XGBoost implementation  
  - LSTM testing  

### Reinforcement Learning (RL) Layer
- Implementing **three RL layers**, one for each model.  
- Adjustments will be made to improve the integration of RL with NLP, LSTM, and XGBoost.  

### Web App API Integration
- Web app will use **FastAPI** to display test results and predictions.  
- API endpoints will be structured for smooth integration with the UI.  

### Trading Chart Page Development
- **Yagiz** will work on the **Trading Chart Page** for the web application.  

## Action Items & Next Steps
- **Adrian**: Develop the testing notebook with NLP, XGBoost, and LSTM.  
- **Yagiz**: Start building the **Trading Chart Page**.  
- **Team**: Prepare the system for **second prototype testing** and finalize test cases for next week’s lab.  
- **API Development**: Implement **FastAPI** for web integration.

### **Brief Summary**

On February 20, 2025, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM, the team met to discuss the continuation of our project, specifically preparing for the second prototype testing and planning next week’s lab testing. We decided to showcase NLP testing with LSTM and XGBoost, leveraging last semester’s work. However, we encountered an issue where NLP APIs only provide data from 2021 onwards, affecting our training process.

To address testing, Adrian will create a notebook compiling NLP, XGBoost, and LSTM tests. We will also integrate three reinforcement learning layers, one for each model. On the web development side, FastAPI will be used to serve API endpoints for testing results, and Yagiz will take the lead on developing the **Trading Chart Page**.
