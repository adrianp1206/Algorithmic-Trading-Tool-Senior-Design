## Introduction

This document summarizes the discussion points and key takeaways from our meeting held on November 16th, 2024. The meeting focused on the preparation for the upcoming prototype presentation, updates on model implementations, and division of tasks among the team members. Additionally, final presentation logistics and semester leadership transition were addressed.

## Agenda

1. **Prototype Presentation Content**
   - Decide on presenting the **LSTM** and **XGBoost** models.
   - Discuss the integration of these models into the **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** framework.
   - Evaluate if the initial stages of the RL model should be showcased, considering their incomplete status.

2. **Model Performance Updates**
   - Running the **LSTM model** on a different stock to validate performance:
     - **TSLA**: Previous successful implementation.
     - **META**: Results were below expectations.
     - **UBER**: Achieved a 3% error rate, a promising outcome.
     - **NVIDIA**: Delivered strong results with a 1.25% error rate.

3. **Technical Updates**
   - **ODI:** Focused on strategy-based indicators like Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels.
   - **Yagiz:** Leading efforts in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks.
   - **Adrian & Gabe:** Concentrating on **XGBoost** implementation and advancing the **RL model**.

## Key Decisions

1. **Prototype Meeting:**
   - Confirmed readiness for the prototype presentation.
   - Emphasis on presenting solid results from LSTM and XGBoost models.
   - Decision pending on whether to include the RL model due to its incomplete status.

2. **Final Presentation Logistics:**
   - Discussed structure and delegation of responsibilities for the final presentation.

3. **Final Report:**
   - Highlighted the importance of documenting key results, methodologies, and challenges faced during the project.

4. **Leadership Transition:**
   - Confirmed **ODI** as the 3rd team lead for this semester.

---

## Action Items

- Continue testing the **LSTM model** on various stocks for robustness.
- Fine-tune **NLP and strategy indicators** for better performance insights.
- Prepare a comprehensive draft for the **final report**.
- Organize a timeline for the final presentation preparation.
