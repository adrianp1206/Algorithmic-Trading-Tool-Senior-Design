- Moving Averages: Identify the trend direction of a stock or determine its support and resistance levels. It is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices.

- Average True Range: Average price range of an investment over a period. If the ATR for an asset is $1.18, its price has an average range of movement of $1.18 per trading day.

- Bollinger Bands: Helps gauge the volatility of stocks and other securities to determine if they are over- or undervalued. 

- Relative Strength Index: Measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.

- Keltner Channel: Tracks volatility using an asset's exponential moving average and average true range.

- Standard Deviation: Measures how widely returns are dispersed from the average return. It’s the most common (and biased) estimator of volatility.

- Parkinson's: Uses the stock’s high and low price of the day rather than just close to close prices. It’s useful to capture large price movements during the day.

- Garman-Klass: Extends Parkinson's volatility by taking into account the opening and closing price. As markets are most active during the opening and closing of a trading session, it makes volatility estimation more accurate.

- Hodges-Tompkins: Is a bias correction for estimation using an overlapping data sample that produces unbiased estimates and a substantial gain in efficiency.

- Rogers-Satchell: Is an estimator for measuring the volatility of securities with an average return not equal to zero. Unlike Parkinson and Garman-Klass estimators, Rogers-Satchell incorporates a drift term (mean return not equal to zero).

- Yang-Zhang: Is the combination of the overnight (close-to-open volatility), a weighted average of the Rogers-Satchell volatility and the day's open-to-close volatility.
