Trend-Following Strategies:

1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy:
    Buy: When the short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day MA) crosses above the long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day MA)
    Sell: When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Strategy:
    Buy: When the RSI falls below 30 (indicating the stock is oversold)
    Sell: When the RSI rises above 70 (indicating the stock is overbought)

3. Bollinger Bands Strategy:
    Buy: When the price touches the lower Bollinger Band (indicating the stock is potentially oversold)
    Sell: When the price touches the upper Bollinger Band (indicating the stock is potentially overbought)

4. Mean Reversion Strategy: 
    Buy: When a stock falls below its 20-day moving average by a certain percentage (e.g., 5%)
    Sell: When the stock price reverts back to or above the 20-day moving average

5. Breakout Strategy:
    Buy: When the stock price breaks above a defined resistance level (e.g., the 30-day high)
    Sell: When the stock price breaks below a defined support level (e.g., the 30-day low)
