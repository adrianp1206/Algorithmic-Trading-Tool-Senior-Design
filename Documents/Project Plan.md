### Senior Design Project Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### Step 1: Gather Historical Data

* Source: Collect historical price data for S\&P 500 E-mini Futures (ES) from platforms like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.  
* Features: Include not only price but also technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) that will serve as inputs to your models.  
* Timeframe: Start with daily data (for long-term trends) but consider adding minute or hourly data later for more frequent trading.

#### Step 2: Feature Engineering

* Technical Indicators: Calculate and add indicators such as moving averages (SMA, EMA), Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD.  
* Sentiment Data: Optionally, use sentiment analysis from news articles or social media (though this is less critical for ES futures).  
* Market Conditions: Develop features that help identify bullish or bearish market conditions (e.g., based on volatility or moving averages).

#### Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Normalize Data: Scale the data for the machine learning models (LSTM and XGBoost benefit from normalized input).  
* Train-Test Split: Split your dataset into training (70-80%) and testing (20-30%) sets for evaluation.  
* Sliding Window: For time series models like LSTM, use sliding windows to create sequences of data (e.g., use the last 30 days to predict the next day).

### Phase 2: Initial Model Development

#### Step 4: Build and Train the LSTM Model

* Purpose: LSTM will be used to predict future price movements based on historical data.  
* Approach:  
  * Build the LSTM architecture with sequential layers (input, LSTM, dense).  
  * Train the model on daily price data and technical indicators.  
  * Output: Predict future price levels or returns.  
* Evaluation:  
  * Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate prediction accuracy on the test set.  
  * Visualize how well the LSTM tracks trends in the price of ES futures.

#### Step 5: Build and Train the XGBoost Model

* Purpose: XGBoost will classify buy, sell, or hold signals based on features like technical indicators, LSTM predictions, and market conditions.  
* Approach:  
  * Train XGBoost to classify trading signals based on input features.  
  * Use features such as technical indicators, momentum, and LSTM predictions.  
  * Output: A classification signal (buy, sell, hold).  
* Evaluation:  
  * Use a confusion matrix and precision-recall to evaluate signal accuracy.  
  * Backtest the XGBoost model by simulating trades based on generated signals.

#### Step 6: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Strategy Optimization

* Purpose: Reinforcement Learning (e.g., DQN) will optimize the trading strategy by interacting with the market environment.  
* Approach:  
  * Define the state (e.g., current price, indicators), actions (buy, sell, hold), and reward function (profit/loss).  
  * Train the RL agent on historical data to learn which actions maximize cumulative returns.  
  * Integrate with the LSTM and XGBoost signals to improve decision-making.  
* Evaluation:  
  * Use Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns to measure performance.  
  * Simulate the RL agent’s performance in a backtesting environment.

### Phase 3: Backtesting and Validation

#### Step 7: Create Backtesting Framework

* Tool: Use a backtesting framework like Backtrader or Zipline to simulate historical trades based on model-generated signals.  
* Metrics:  
  * Cumulative returns: How much profit/loss the strategy would have generated over time.  
  * Sharpe ratio: Risk-adjusted returns.  
  * Maximum drawdown: Largest loss from peak to trough.

#### Step 8: Tune Hyperparameters

* LSTM: Tune the number of layers, units, and dropout rate to prevent overfitting.  
* XGBoost: Adjust parameters like learning rate, max depth, and subsampling rate.  
* Reinforcement Learning: Fine-tune the reward function to ensure it maximizes long-term returns and adjusts to the risk profile of ES futures.

#### Step 9: Cross-Validation

* Implement cross-validation to avoid overfitting and ensure that your models generalize well to unseen data.

### Phase 4: Deploying and Monitoring the System

#### Step 10: Build User Interface

* Create a web-based dashboard using Dash, maybe React (we can decide later) for:  
  * Monitoring current trading signals.  
  * Visualizing portfolio performance (e.g., returns, Sharpe ratio).  
  * Displaying real-time data and model predictions.

#### Step 11: Continuous Improvement and Adaptation

* Monitor model performance in real time to identify underperforming models.  
* Incorporate new algorithms (e.g., SARIMA for seasonality, Random Forest for feature selection).  
* Adapt the models based on market regime shifts (bull vs. bear markets).

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (If Time Permits)

* Dynamic Risk Management: Implement risk-adjusted position sizing based on volatility or drawdown levels.  
* Real-Time Trading: Once you’ve tested models sufficiently, consider connecting to a paper trading platform (e.g., Interactive Brokers, QuantConnect) for live simulation.  
* Expand to Multiple Assets: Test the strategy on other indices (e.g., NASDAQ 100 E-mini Futures) or individual assets after refining your ES futures model.
