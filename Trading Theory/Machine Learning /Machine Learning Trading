Definition:
Machine learning-based trading strategies utilize algorithms to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and
make predictions about future price movements. These strategies adapt and improve over time as they process new data,
allowing for more sophisticated trading decisions.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Gathering Data: Historical market data (price, volume, etc.), alternative data (social media sentiment, economic indicators), and technical indicators are collected for analysis.
- Cleaning Data: Data is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the quality of the input data for the model.

2. Feature Engineering:
- Creating Features: Relevant features (predictors) are derived from raw data. This can include Price changes over various
time frames (e.g., moving averages, returns). Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD). Fundamental data (e.g., earnings reports,
economic indicators).
- Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be used to reduce the number of features
while preserving variance, enhancing model performance.

3. Model Selection and Training:
- Various machine learning algorithms can be employed, such as:
    a. Supervised Learning: Techniques like regression (linear regression, logistic regression), decision trees, random forests,
      gradient boosting, or neural networks are used when labeled data (i.e., past price movements) is available.
    b. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering methods (e.g., K-means) might be applied to find patterns without predefined labels,
      useful for identifying market regimes.
- Training the Model: The selected model is trained on historical data, where it learns to identify relationships between features and target variables (e.g., future price movements).

4. Model Evaluation:
- Backtesting: The model's performance is evaluated using historical data not included in the training set. Metrics such as accuracy,
  precision, recall, and F1 score help assess model effectiveness.
- Performance Metrics: Financial metrics, like Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown, are crucial to evaluate the strategy's risk-adjusted returns.

5. Execution of Trades:
- Signal Generation: The trained model generates trading signals based on predictions (e.g., buy if the expected price change exceeds a certain threshold).
- Algorithmic Trading: Algorithms automatically execute trades based on the signals, optimizing for speed and efficiency to capitalize on identified opportunities.

6. Risk Management
- Position Sizing: Risk management techniques are implemented, such as defining position sizes based on the model’s confidence level and market volatility.
- Monitoring and Adjusting: The model’s performance is continuously monitored. If performance declines, retraining or adjusting the model may be necessary.

Challenges to consider:
- Overfitting: Models may become too complex, fitting noise rather than genuine patterns in historical data, leading to poor out-of-sample performance.
- Data Quality: The effectiveness of machine learning models depends heavily on the quality and relevance of the data used for training.
- Interpretability: Many machine learning models (especially deep learning) operate as "black boxes," making it challenging to interpret the rationale behind specific predictions.
