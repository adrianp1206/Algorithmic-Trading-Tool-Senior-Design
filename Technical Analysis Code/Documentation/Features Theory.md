- Beta: Denotes the volatility or systematic risk of a security or portfolio compared to the market, usually the S&P 500 which has a beta of 1.0. Stocks with betas higher than 1.0 are interpreted as more volatile than the S&P 500.

- Moving Averages: Identifies the trend direction of a stock or determine its support and resistance levels. It is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices.

- Average True Range: Averages price range of an investment over a period. If the ATR for an asset is $1.18, its price has an average range of movement of $1.18 per trading day.

- Rate of Change (ROC): Measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. The ROC indicator is plotted against zero, with the indicator moving upwards into positive territory if price changes are to the upside, and moving into negative territory if price changes are to the downside.

- Stochastic Oscillator: Compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0–100 bounded range of values.

- Bollinger Bands: Helps gauge the volatility of stocks and other securities to determine if they are over- or undervalued. 

- Relative Strength Index: Measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.

- Keltner Channel: Tracks volatility using an asset's exponential moving average and average true range.

- Standard Deviation: Measures how widely returns are dispersed from the average return. It’s the most common (and biased) estimator of volatility.

- Parkinson's: Uses the stock’s high and low price of the day rather than just close to close prices. It’s useful to capture large price movements during the day.

- Garman-Klass: Extends Parkinson's volatility by taking into account the opening and closing price. As markets are most active during the opening and closing of a trading session, it makes volatility estimation more accurate.

- Hodges-Tompkins: Is a bias correction for estimation using an overlapping data sample that produces unbiased estimates and a substantial gain in efficiency.

- Rogers-Satchell: Is an estimator for measuring the volatility of securities with an average return not equal to zero. Unlike Parkinson and Garman-Klass estimators, Rogers-Satchell incorporates a drift term (mean return not equal to zero).

- Yang-Zhang: Is the combination of the overnight (close-to-open volatility), a weighted average of the Rogers-Satchell volatility and the day's open-to-close volatility.
